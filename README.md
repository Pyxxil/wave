# Wave

This project is a crossover fork of two projects:

-   [react-rpg](https://github.com/ASteinheiser/react-rpg.com): The original turn based, dungeon-crawling, RPG made in React + Redux
-   [roll for reaction](https://github.com/Matteas-Eden/roll-for-reaction): A fork of the above created in a group project by students in the 2020 Semester One as part of the COMPSCI 732 / SOFTENG 750 course at the University of Auckland.

This project is mostly based off of the latter, and is to be treated as more of a rewrite in Typescript of this project.

A hosted version is both found on [gitlab](https://pyxxilated-studios.gitlab.io/wave/) and at [Pyxxilated Studios](https://www.pyxxilated.studio/wave/).
